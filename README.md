Graceful degradation is about building a fully-featured app first and making sure it still works when certain features or technologies aren't available. Service workers help with this by allowing web apps to work offline or in poor network conditions. They provide a safety net by caching key files and data, so users can still interact with the app even if they lose connection. This helps the app stay functional and useful instead of breaking completely.
